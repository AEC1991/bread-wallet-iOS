ge means group element.

Here the group is the set of pairs (x,y) of field elements (see fe.h)
satisfying -x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2y^2
where d = -121665/121666.

Representations:
  ge_p2 (projective): (X:Y:Z) satisfying x=X/Z, y=Y/Z
  ge_p3 (extended): (X:Y:Z:T) satisfying x=X/Z, y=Y/Z, XY=ZT
  ge_p1p1 (completed): ((X:Z),(Y:T)) satisfying x=X/Z, y=Y/T
  ge_precomp (Duif): (y+x,y-x,2dxy)
